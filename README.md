# Text Classification in Banking Transactions
Text classification task on banking transaction descriptions in order to separate them into different distinct categories. This project portrays a realistic use case of text classification, where we attempt to build a model that can predict which bank transaction category a specific transaction falls within, purely by using the associated bank transaction text.

We go through the entire machine learning workflow, from exploratory data analysis of the excel spreadsheet to give insights into the useful features we could extract from the dataset, to creating the model, training it, iterating over different models, and finally evaluating the final performance of the model. The Jupyter Notebook also describes the thought process behind each step in detail using text embedded between code sections.
